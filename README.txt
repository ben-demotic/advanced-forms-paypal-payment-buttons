Create PayPal Payment Buttons with the power of Advanced Forms and Advanced Custom Fields.

== Description ==

If you have the Advanced Custom Fields plugin installed, you'll already know that you can use it
to create complex and powerful front-end forms. But displaying those forms on a page requires PHP
coding. 

Enter Advanced Forms, which allows you to configure a form and display it on a page using 
a shortcode. Advanced Forms can be used for all the forms on your WordPress site - like your contact
forms. 

Now you can configure your Advanced Forms form to take "Buy Now" or "Donate" payments on PayPal.

Advanced Forms PayPal Payment Buttons supports:

* A long list of variables which can be passed in a payment button.
* Store live and sandbox account details and configure the form mode for each form.
* Encrypt your PayPal buttons for security.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure Advanced Custom Fields Pro v5 is installed.
2. Make sure Advanced Forms is installed.
3. Upload `advanced-forms-paypal-payment-buttons.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Configure the "PayPal Settings" in Forms > PayPal Settings.
